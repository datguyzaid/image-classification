# 📸 Image Classification Projects

This repository contains a collection of image classification projects that I completed during my 2nd year of university in 2021. These projects cover a wide range of image classification tasks using various machine learning and deep learning techniques. Explore, learn, and use these projects for your own purposes.

## Project List 📜

1. **MNIST Handwritten Digit Classifier** ✍️
   - Classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using machine learning algorithms.

2. **CIFAR-10 Image Classifier** 🎨
   - Classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, including 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 different classes.

3. **Cats vs Dogs Classifier** 🐱🐶
   - Distinguish between images of cats and dogs using deep learning techniques. A classic binary classification problem.

4. **EMNIST Alphanumeric Classifier** 🔤
   - Classify handwritten alphanumeric characters from the Extended MNIST dataset.

5. **Fruits Classifier** 🍎🍌🍇
   - Identify various types of fruits from images. A fun and visually appealing project for fruit lovers.

6. **Fashion MNIST Clothing Classifier** 👗👠
   - Classify clothing items from the Fashion MNIST dataset, including various types of apparel.

7. **Food-11 Classifier Using VGG16** 🍔🍕🍝
   - Implement a food classifier using the VGG16 architecture. Identify different types of food items from images.

8. **Monkey Breed Classifier Using MobileNetV1** 🐒
   - Create a classifier for different monkey breeds using the MobileNetV1 model. A great example of transfer learning.

9. **Flower-17 Classifier Using VGG16** 🌸🌼🌻
   - Classify various flower species using the VGG16 architecture, showcasing the power of deep learning for fine-grained tasks.

10. **Simpsons Character Classifier Using ResNet50V2** 📺
    - Identify characters from the popular TV show "The Simpsons" using the ResNet50V2 model.

11. **Sign Language Detection** 🤟
    - Build a model that recognizes sign language gestures, enabling communication for individuals with hearing impairments.

## How to Use 🚀

Each project is organized into its respective folder within this repository. You will find self-explanatory Jupyter Notebook within that for each project within its folder. To get started with a particular project, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project folder of your choice.
2. Go through the Jupyter Notebook within the project folder to know about the dataset, model architecture, and overall code.
3. Download any required dataset or install any required libraries.
4. Follow instructions to run the code and train the model.
5. Explore the code and adapt it for your own purposes.
